# ToolsList
A list of tools to build applications

## Cross-platform Application builder:
Build a Webapp and convert it to desktop App
[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/): Uses by a lot of importat organizations, stable for production but heavy (wrapped in a chomium, eat a lot of ram)
[Tauri](https://tauri.app/): Quite new, build in rust, super small bundle size. Have planning for mobile support in the roadmap

## Editors:
[react-quill](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-quill): A prebuild text editor, react version. Live demo [here](https://zenoamaro.github.io/react-quill/)
